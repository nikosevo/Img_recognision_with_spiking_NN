# Img_recognision_with_spiking_NN
Using SNN torch I created a program that recognises hand written digits. The standard MNIST database was used for the training.

The snn_img_rec folders contains a demonstration of how the snn works.
To test it, you need to execute snn_img_rec and allow access to your camera. 
Then draw on a piece of paper a number between 0-9. Display it to the camera(the number should be as much centered as possible)
hit Space to capture the image and look at the terminal if the answer is correct.

The training files are also included in case you would love to play with it yourself
